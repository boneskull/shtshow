> Temperature & humidity sensor Thing using [ESP8266] + [MQTT] + [SHT30].  Built with [PlatformIO] and [Homie]

## Hardware

I'm using a [Wemos D1 Mini] and a [SHT30 Shield].  Any ESP8266 and any SHT3x *should* work.

You probably want to be using a [dual base] to avoid heat interference from the ESP8266 itself. 

> *Note*: Wemos' SHT30 has a I2C address of `0x45`, whereas the factory setting is `0x44`.  If you have the shield and need to use `0x45`, solder these two pads together:

## Installation (From Binary)

1. Wire up hardware
1. Download the appropriate firmware for your D1 Mini board from the [latest release]
1. Open the archive
1. Use [esptool] to flash your board with the firmware
1. Follow [Homie's setup instructions]

## Installation (From Source)

1. Wire up hardware
1. Get [PlatformIO]
1. Clone repo
1. Use PlatformIO to flash device
1. Optionally, create `data/homie/config.json` and use PlatformIO to upload to SPIFFS
1. Follow [Homie's setup instructions]

## Notes

- [Wemos' provided library] is hinky and **not recommended**.
- This firmware uses [ClosedCube's library] instead.
- For the D1 Mini, I had best results with `WAKE_RF_DEFAULT` when entering deep sleep. YMMV.
- Likewise, I'm not sure clock stretching works very well on an ESP8266, so we're using the SHT30's "periodic" mode.
